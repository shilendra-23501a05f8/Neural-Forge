Target difficulty guidelines:
- Easy: tests basic definitions, syntax, simple concepts.
- Medium: tests practical tasks, coding scenarios, simple system design, conflict resolution.
- Hard: tests complex architecture, scaling, deep system troubleshooting, severe trade-offs.

Behavioral Question Guidelines:
- If Target Category is "behavioral", generate a standard, interpersonal/soft-skills behavioral question (e.g., conflict resolution, handling tight deadlines, coping with project changes, communicating with non-technical stakeholders, or dealing with mistakes).
- Do NOT make the behavioral question heavily technical or require deep system-design/coding problem solving. Keep it focused on human scenarios and collaboration, contextualized to the role (e.g. "Tell me about a time you had a difference of opinion with a team member. How did you resolve it and work together?").

Rule:
- Do NOT generate questions similar to or covering the exact same topics already present in the "Previous Question/Answer History".
- Make the question direct, specific, and realistic for a candidate applying for: "${jobRole}".
